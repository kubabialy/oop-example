# OOP Example

## Context

This repository was created to illustrate ways to write TypeScript code using OOP.
It is a very simplified implementation solving an equally simple problem to distinguish between HTTP, business and database layers.

This is by no means a perfect implementation, but it gives a reasonably good idea of how the code in question might look.
